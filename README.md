This is the main repository for ShiraKamiSRS. It is a self-hostable Spaced Repetition System (SRS) specifically geared towards learning Japanese vocabulary, heavily inspired by [WaniKani](https://wanikani.com/).

Want to get started? A publicly hosted instance is available over at [shirakamisrs.com](https://shirakamisrs.com/)!

**Note:** Currently, ShiraKamiSRS is still in its very early stages. A lot of very basic/obvious functionality is still missing. Check out what is planned [here](#roadmap)!

## Roadmap

Currently, ShiraKamiSRS is in my opinion still missing a lot of basic features. I probably have more things I still want to do than I could list here, but I do think it is important to list a few major ones here so it is known they are still coming

- User Settings<br>
  Currently there is no way for users to manage their own settings. In the future, users should be able to change their account information such as their email, username, or avatar.
- User Management<br>
  Especially for people who administer their own instance of ShiraKamiSRS, it would be useful to be able to manage their users. 
- Skipping/Ignoring lessons<br>
  Sometimes it would be useful to ignore or skip a lesson, especially when there is some overlap between cards. Currently the only way to do this is to delete the card from your set. 
- User synonyms<br>
  It would be useful if users could add their own synonyms, without having to make their changes part of the card. 
- Bug fixes<br>
  There are still quite a few bugs, some of which I know about and some I don't. 
  
If you have any other features you would like to suggest, or bugs you found that need to be fixed, feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/BeMacized/ShiraKamiSRS/issues/new) or come talk over in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/dvsgnxWUr5)!
