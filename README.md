This is the main repository for ShiraKamiSRS. It is a self-hostable Spaced Repetition System (SRS) specifically geared towards learning Japanese vocabulary, heavily inspired by [WaniKani](https://wanikani.com/).

Want to get started? A publicly hosted instance is available over at [shirakamisrs.com](https://shirakamisrs.com/)!

**Note:** Currently, ShiraKamiSRS is still in its very early stages. A lot of very basic/obvious functionality is still missing. Check out what is planned [here](#roadmap)!
